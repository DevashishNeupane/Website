        <p> <img id="Linkedln-Pic" src="Linkedin.jpg"> Hello, my name Devashish Neupane. I mostly just go by "Dev" because it makes it a lot easier for people. <br>
            I am a senior at UNO, and my major is Management Information Systems (M.I.S.). It's quite scary knowing <br> that this
            is my last year and afterwards I'm out in the <em>"real"</em> world.
            After graduating from UNO I will be attending <br> Columbia or New York University to get my
            MBA. My career goal is to be a Technology Consultant. I also <br> hope to work for any Fortune 500 companies
            in New York. I also want to get involved with my community once I live in New York. <br>
            I especially want to help non-profit organizations, especially those that currently provide resource support <br>
            to children in underdeveloped countries like Nepal, my hometown, or India.
